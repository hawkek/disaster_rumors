## Problem Statement

While social media increasingly becomes the first source of information about disasters, this information is not always correct. Posts can be misleading or mistaken. On rarer occasions, users intentionally spread misinformation. In short, can we produce a machine learning model to identify whether tweets are related to disaster events and to assess their credibility?
